abstract: |

  In this paper, we present a novel system designed to enable participants to share their grasping experiences with others in virtual reality. To evaluate the efficacy of this shared experience, we conducted a psychophysical experiment aimed to assess the participants' ability to discriminate between different sizes under different touch modes. Our pilot results suggest that passive touch, specifically when the hand remains stationary, lead to the higher mean accuracy  compared to both active touch and and passive touch involving mimicking movements, challenging our initial hypotheses about the impact of different touch modalities.
