abstract: |

  In this paper, our experimental results demonstrate that the combination of sliding cutaneous feedback and visual feedback can induce a durable and replicable virtual hand illusion. Moreover, this illusion has the potential to enhance tactile perception, particularly in the accurate assessment of lump size. These findings hold implications for the advancement of remote health applications. Future research is necessary to investigate this phenomenon across a wider range of variables, such as location, stiffness, mobility, and depth.
