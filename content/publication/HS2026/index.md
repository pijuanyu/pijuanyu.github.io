abstract: |
  Remote palpation enables noninvasive tissue examination in telemedicine, yet current tactile displays often lack the fidelity to convey both large-scale forces and fine spatial details. This study introduces a hybrid fingertip display comprising a rigid platform and a 4 x 4 soft pneumatic tactile display (4.93 mm displacement and 1.175 N per single pneumatic chamber) to render a hard lump beneath soft tissue. This study compares three rendering strategies: a Platform-Only baseline that renders the total interaction force; a Hybrid A (Position + Force Feedback) strategy that adds a dynamic, real-time soft spatial cue; and a Hybrid B (Position + Preloaded Stiffness Feedback) strategy that provides a constant, pre-calculated soft spatial cue.

  In a 12-participant lump detection study, both hybrid methods dramatically improved accuracy over the Platform-Only baseline (from 50% to over 95%). While the Hybrid B was highlighted qualitatively for realism, its event-based averaging is expected to increase interaction latency in real-time operation. This suggests a trade-off between perceived lump realism and real-time responsiveness, such that rendering choices that enhance realism may conflict with those that minimize latency.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper presented a novel hybrid haptic display that significantly improves performance in a remote palpation task by combining large-scale force feedback with fine-grained contact area cues.
