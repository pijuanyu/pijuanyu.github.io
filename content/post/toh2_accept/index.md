## Key Contribution
This study explores a virtual user's ability to interpret one tactile feature, object size, when receiving touch feedback from a commercial haptic glove during either an active or passive grasp interaction. Although passive conditions resulted in poorer size acuity than during active touch, passive performance improved when participants mimicked the motion of the virtual hand, underscoring the role of proprioceptive feedback in grasp interpretation. Additionally, gender differences in performance suggest potential influences of glove ergonomics and size congruency between the real and virtual hand. 
Future research should investigate these variables and strive for balanced gender representation to assess generalization across VR applications.
