## Key Contribution
This study explored different passive presentation techniques for communicating an active palpation task, using a robotic platform that can provide a passive hand with visual and haptic feedback recorded from an active hand. While there is a slight decreases (8% to 11.7%) in perceptual acuity and confidence across all passive presentation conditions, many participants did experience sizable rubber hand illusions and kinesthetic illusions from synchronized visio-haptic feedback during passive presentation. These results suggest promise for creating a sense of immersion to a passive viewer of active hands-on experience.
