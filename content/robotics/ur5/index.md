## Simulation Results

{{< youtube id="Ddppyfx4en4" title="Dual UR5 Collaborative Assembly Demonstration" >}}

## Project Overview

This project presents a sophisticated dual-arm collaborative robotic assembly system featuring two Universal Robots UR5 manipulators working in coordination to assemble complex objects from multiple components. The system integrates advanced robotics software including ROS (Robot Operating System), MoveIt! motion planning framework, and CoppeliaSim simulation environment, all containerized using Docker for cross-platform compatibility.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Configuration
- **Primary Manipulator**: UR5 6-DOF robot arm (Right arm)
- **Secondary Manipulator**: UR5 6-DOF robot arm (Left arm) 
- **End-Effectors**: RG2 pneumatic parallel grippers on both arms
- **Material Handling**: Three conveyor belt systems for component supply and product output
- **Sensing**: Proximity ultrasonic sensors (cone and ray types) for object detection

### Software Stack
- **Simulation Platform**: CoppeliaSim with physics engine
- **Motion Planning**: MoveIt! framework for trajectory generation
- **Communication**: CoppeliaSim Remote API for sensor integration
- **Containerization**: Docker environment for cross-platform deployment

## Assembly Process Workflow

The collaborative assembly follows an eight-stage synchronized workflow:

### Stage 1: Component Detection and Acquisition
Both UR5 arms simultaneously monitor their respective conveyor belts using proximity sensors to detect incoming components at random positions.

### Stage 2: Synchronized Pick-Up Operations  
- **Right UR5**: Acquires the primary structural component
- **Left UR5**: Sequentially picks up minor components (cylinder, cuboid, X-shaped column, H-shaped column)

### Stage 3: Coordinated Movement to Assembly Zone
Both manipulators move to the predetermined assembly workspace located centrally between the two robot bases.

### Stage 4: Precision Assembly Operations
The left UR5 performs insertion operations, carefully placing each minor component into the primary structure held by the right UR5.

### Stage 5: Component Integration Cycle
The left arm returns to acquire the next component while the right arm maintains precise positioning of the assembly.

### Stage 6: Assembly Completion Verification
The system verifies all components are properly integrated using sensor feedback and positional constraints.

### Stage 7: Product Transfer and Output
The right UR5 places the completed assembly onto the output conveyor belt for transportation.

### Stage 8: System Reset and Next Cycle Preparation
Both manipulators return to their ready positions to begin the next assembly cycle.

## Technical Implementation

### ROS Node Architecture

```python
# Core control nodes
â”œâ”€â”€ Robot_control.py          # Central sensor interface and API functions
â”œâ”€â”€ Left.py                   # Left UR5 controller with MoveIt! integration  
â”œâ”€â”€ Right.py                  # Right UR5 controller with MoveIt! integration
â””â”€â”€ dual_moveit.launch        # MoveIt! configuration for dual-arm coordination
```

### CoppeliaSim Integration

Three child scripts handle simulation interface:
1. **Remote API Script**: Establishes communication bridge between CoppeliaSim and ROS
2. **Joint State Publisher**: Publishes real-time joint positions for both UR5 arms
3. **Sensor Data Publisher**: Transmits proximity sensor readings and conveyor status

### Motion Planning Strategy

The system employs hierarchical motion planning:

**Global Coordination Level**
- Task scheduling and synchronization between arms
- Collision avoidance in shared workspace
- Optimal trajectory timing for efficiency

**Individual Arm Control Level**  
- MoveIt! path planning for each manipulator
- Joint-space and Cartesian-space trajectory optimization
- Real-time obstacle avoidance and constraint satisfaction

### Sensor-Based Feedback Control

```python
# Sensor integration workflow
def sensor_callback(sensor_data):
    """Process proximity sensor feedback"""
    object_detected = process_ultrasonic_data(sensor_data)
    if object_detected:
        target_pose = calculate_grasp_pose(object_position)
        execute_pickup_sequence(target_pose)
```

## Advanced Features

### Collision Avoidance System
- Real-time collision checking between manipulators in shared workspace
- Dynamic safety zones that adapt based on current robot configurations
- Emergency stop capabilities with immediate trajectory abortion

### Adaptive Grasp Planning

- Force-feedback integration for secure component grasping  
- Adaptive gripper control based on component geometry and material properties

### Fault Tolerance and Recovery
- Automatic error detection and recovery sequences
- Component drop detection with re-acquisition capabilities
- System state monitoring with diagnostic reporting

## Docker Containerization

### Environment Standardization
The entire system runs in a carefully configured Docker container ensuring:
- **Cross-platform compatibility** across different operating systems
- **Dependency management** with locked software versions
- **Reproducible deployment** for research and development teams

### Container Configuration
```bash
# Quick deployment commands
docker start -i $CONTAINER_NAME
byobu                          # Terminal session management
roscore                        # ROS master node
roslaunch dual_arm dual_moveit.launch    # Motion planning
roslaunch dual_arm total.launch          # Complete system
```
