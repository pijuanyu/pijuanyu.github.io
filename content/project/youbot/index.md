## Simulation Results

{{< youtube id="BEbqcsws210" title="YouBot Mobile Manipulation Demonstration" >}}

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete mobile manipulation control system for the KUKA youBot mobile manipulator, consisting of a omnidirectional mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5-DOF robot arm. The system autonomously plans trajectories, performs odometry-based localization, and executes feedback control to pick up a block from a specified location and place it at a desired destination.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Configuration
- **Mobile Base**: Omnidirectional chassis with 4 mecanum wheels
  - Forward-backward distance: 2l = 0.47 m
  - Side-to-side distance: 2w = 0.3 m  
  - Wheel radius: r = 0.0475 m
- **Manipulator**: 5R serial robot arm with gripper end-effector
- **Total DOF**: 8 (3 chassis + 5 arm) + 4 wheels = 12 controllable degrees of freedom

### Coordinate Systems
1. **Space Frame {s}**: Fixed world reference frame
2. **Body Frame {b}**: Mobile base frame (height: 0.0963 m above floor)
3. **Arm Base Frame {0}**: Fixed offset from chassis frame
4. **End-Effector Frame {e}**: Gripper coordinate system

## Mathematical Modeling

### Kinematic Formulation

The chassis configuration is described by the SE(3) matrix:

$$T_{sb}(q) = \begin{bmatrix} 
\cos\phi & -\sin\phi & 0 & x \\
\sin\phi & \cos\phi & 0 & y \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0.0963 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$

where $q = (\phi, x, y)$ represents the chassis configuration.

### Forward Kinematics

The end-effector configuration is computed using the product of exponentials formula:

$$T_{se}(\theta) = T_{sb}(q) T_{b0} e^{[\mathcal{B}_1]\theta_1} e^{[\mathcal{B}_2]\theta_2} \cdots e^{[\mathcal{B}_5]\theta_5} M_{0e}$$

where $\mathcal{B}_i$ are the body screw axes and $\theta = (\theta_1, ..., \theta_5)$ are joint angles.

### Jacobian Control

The mobile manipulator Jacobian combines base and arm contributions:

$$\mathcal{V}_e = J_e(\theta) \dot{u}$$

where $\dot{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, \dot{\theta}_1, ..., \dot{\theta}_5)^T$ contains wheel speeds and joint velocities.

## Control System Design

### Feedback Control Law

The system implements a feedforward-plus-PI controller:

$$\mathcal{V}(t) = [Ad_{X^{-1}X_d}]\mathcal{V}_d(t) + K_p X_{err}(t) + K_i \int_0^t X_{err}(\tau) d\tau$$

where:
- $\mathcal{V}_d(t)$: feedforward reference twist
- $X_{err}(t)$: end-effector pose error
- $K_p, K_i$: proportional and integral gain matrices

### Trajectory Generation

The reference trajectory consists of eight concatenated segments:

1. **Standoff Approach**: Move gripper to position above target block
2. **Descent**: Lower gripper to grasp configuration  
3. **Grasp**: Close gripper (0.625s duration)
4. **Lift**: Raise block to standoff position
5. **Transport**: Move to destination standoff position
6. **Descent**: Lower block to final position
7. **Release**: Open gripper (0.625s duration)
8. **Retract**: Return to standoff configuration

Each segment uses either:
- **Screw trajectories**: Constant screw motion with polynomial time scaling
- **Cartesian trajectories**: Decoupled linear and rotational motion

## Implementation Details

### Core Functions Developed

```matlab
% Kinematic simulation with odometry
NextState(config, controls, dt, speedlimits)

% Reference trajectory generation
TrajectoryGenerator(Tse_initial, Tsc_initial, Tsc_final, Tce_grasp, Tce_standoff, k)

% Feedback control law implementation  
FeedbackControl(X, Xd, Xd_next, Kp, Ki, dt)

% Joint limit enforcement (optional)
testJointLimits(theta)
```

### Odometry Implementation

Mobile base odometry follows the algorithm from Chapter 13.4 of Modern Robotics:

$$\Delta q = F(\Delta\theta)^{-1} \Delta\theta$$

where $F(\Delta\theta)$ relates wheel angle changes to chassis motion.

### Performance Analysis

The simulation demonstrates successful pick-and-place operations with:

**Phase 1 - Initial Positioning**: Robot navigates to block location while correcting initial pose errors through feedback control.

**Phase 2 - Manipulation Sequence**: Eight-segment trajectory execution with precise gripper control:
- Standoff positioning with 2cm clearance above block
- Controlled descent maintaining orientation alignment  
- Robust grasping despite physics simulation uncertainties
- Smooth transport motion coordinating base and arm
- Accurate placement at goal configuration

**Phase 3 - Error Convergence**: PI feedback control eliminates initial errors:
- Position error: < 0.2m initially â†’ < 1mm at grasp
- Orientation error: < 30Â° initially â†’ < 1Â° at grasp

### Validation Methodology

The system was tested using CoppeliaSim Scene 6 with ODE physics engine:
- **Simulation timestep**: 0.01 seconds (10ms)
- **Controller frequency**: 100 Hz
- **Physics validation**: Contact forces, friction, and collision dynamics
- **Default test case**: Block from (1,0,0) to (0,-1,-Ï€/2)

## Technical Achievements

### Advanced Features Implemented

1. **Singularity Avoidance**: Pseudoinverse with tolerance tuning prevents excessive joint velocities near kinematic singularities

2. **Joint Limit Enforcement**: Optional constraints prevent self-collisions and maintain workspace boundaries

3. **Adaptive Control**: Jacobian nullspace projection handles redundant manipulator control

4. **Physics Integration**: Realistic dynamics simulation with contact forces and friction

### Engineering Validation

- **Kinematic Accuracy**: Forward/inverse kinematics validated against analytical solutions
- **Control Performance**: Step response analysis with overshoot < 5%  
- **Robustness Testing**: Successful manipulation under Â±30Â° initial orientation errors
- **Real-time Capability**: Algorithm execution time < 1ms per control cycle
