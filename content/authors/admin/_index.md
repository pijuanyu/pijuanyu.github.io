      Responsibilities include:
      - Developed a robotic visuo-haptic platform for remote medical palpation; achieved 75% tumor diagnostic accuracy in 18 participants, proving passive haptic feedback alone sufficed for size perception (Published).
      - Engineered a wearable VR haptic glove with Unity-integrated force feedback; 40-subject study showed 25% tactile acuity gain via mimicking motions, validating proprioception’s role in VR interaction (in Progress).

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
